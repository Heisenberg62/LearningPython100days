Functions with outputs

We've seen functions with only an execution body, functions with inputs that allow for variation in execution of the function body and now we'll see the final form of functions. 
Functions that can have outputs.


You can create a function with a body, input and output like this:

def function_name(input_parameter):
    <body of function that uses input_argument>
    return output

format_name(f_name="bsafmnas dsfsdf".title(),l_name="sdsad sadsad".title())

Note : return is not the alternative of print() function. 
Print vs. Output
Return vs. Display: The return statement is used to give back a value from a function, which can be used later, while print is used to display a value to the console only for the programmer to see.

---------------------------------EXAMPLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

def format_name (f_name, l_name):
    return f_name+" "+l_name.title()
def address (address1):
    return address1.title()

formated_name = format_name("first name", "last name")
print(formated_name)
second_return = address(formated_name)
print (second_return)
combo_function = formated_name + second_return
print(combo_function)

Multiple Return Values

Functions terminate at the return keyword. If you write code below the return statement that code will not be executed.
However, you can have multiple return statements in one function. So how does that work?

Conditional Returns
When we have control flow, as in the code will behave differently (go down different execution paths) depending on certain conditional checks, we can end up with multiple endings (returns).

e.g.

def canBuyAlcohol(age):
    if age >= 18:
        return True
    else:
        return False

Empty Returns
You can also write return without anything afterwards, and this just tells the function to exit(but we will get none in the output).

e.g.

def canBuyAlcohol(age):
    # If the data type of the age input is not a int, then exit.
    if type(age) != int:
        return

    if age >= 18:
        return True
    else:
        return False

------------------------------LEAP YEAR -----------------------
my code-----------
def is_leap_year(year):
    if year%4==0:
       if year%100:
          if year%400:
              return True
          else:
              return False
       else:
           return True
    else :
        return False
    
is_leap_year(2024)

SOlution was exactly the same it but it still did not worked out,
eror found i for got to mention the ==0 which i was thinking in my mind i have already written but it was not there.
Note: if any Doubt always check the code in the thonny in debugging mode.

optimal solution was in three lines including function and calling the function.

-------------------------------------solution----------------------------------------
def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False
is_leap_year(20)
