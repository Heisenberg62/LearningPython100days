Before I start writing any code, I first create a flowchart for the program. 
This helps me understand the problem better and solve many issues right at the planning stage.

# import art
# print(art.logo)
def add(n1, n2):
    return n1 + n2
def subtract(n1, n2):
    return n1 - n2
def divide(n1, n2):
    return n1 / n2
def multiply(n1, n2):
    return n1 * n2
#note using () with function will trigger the function as we just want to assign as value dont use fun() just use fun
operations = {
    "+":add,
    "-":subtract,
    "*":multiply,
    "/":divide,
}
continue_loop = ""
# operations["*"] is equals to multiply and it is equals to def multiply(n1, n2):
#     return n1 * n2 that means we can directly assign the values after operations["*"](4,8)
# op = operations["*"]
# print(op(4,8))
want_to_continue = True
while want_to_continue:
 f_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
 operand = input("Enter the operation you want to perform\n'+', \n'-', \n'*' \n'/': ")
 s_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
 output = operations[operand](f_number, s_number)
 print(output)
 want_to_continue = input(f"type y to continue with {output} or n to start new calculation")
 if want_to_continue == "y":
     output2_loop = True
     while output2_loop:
         operand = input("Enter the operation you want to perform\n'+', \n'-', \n'*' \n'/': ")
         s_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
         output2 = operations[operand](output, s_number)
         print(output2)
         output = output2
         want_to_continue = input(f"type y to continue with {output2} or n to start new calculation")
 else:
     want_to_continue = True
